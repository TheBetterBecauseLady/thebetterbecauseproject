		missionTitle: 'Who We Are',
		textOne: 'The Better Because Project seeks to fill the need for stories about how we’ve changed for the better because of what we’ve gone through with our mental health experiences, and about the growth and fulfillment that can come with these journeys. Most of us are very familiar with stories about the bad stuff: loss, stigma, discrimination, and pain. Some of us can get so caught up in stopping the bad stuff from happening to ourselves and to others that we may not have had a chance to pause and think about how much better our lives are now than when we were at our lowest point. The Better Because Project wants to encourage people to celebrate the wonderful things that are in our lives, sometimes as a direct result of what we’ve been through - things that are actively better because of what we’ve been through.',
		titleTwo: 'Big or Small, Better or Well',
		textTwo: '“Better” doesn’t necessarily mean “well;” it just means…better. If we picture the path out of the valley of our darkest days as a trip up a steep mountainside, each of us will be at different points along the way; it doesn’t matter if our trips are different lengths, or if we take different paths, or even whether we ever reach the top of the mountain. No matter where you are in your mental health journey, we invite you to take a moment to enjoy the view: turn around, look behind you, and appreciate how far you’ve come. This project is an opportunity for us to celebrate our successes, provide hope and inspiration to one another, and recognize our achievements. Nothing is too small or too big to share here, and whatever you’ve been through, we want to hear how you survived it and what you’re celebrating today.'
